# GNOME Shortcuts Per App

This GNOME Shell extension allows you to dynamically remap custom system shortcuts based on the currently focused application. It provides a quick settings toggle to enable or disable per-app shortcut mapping, and a settings modal where you can capture the active window, assign, edit, or delete shortcuts.

## Features
- Remap GNOME custom shortcuts on a per-application basis
- Quick settings toggle for easy enable/disable
- Settings dialog to manage shortcuts
- Capture the active windowâ€™s class for easy configuration
- Copy window class names to clipboard for convenience
- View, add, edit, and delete shortcuts via a user-friendly interface

## How it works
- Open your window of choice and access the settings from the App Shortcuts quick settings tile, find the window name and create a shortcut for the window name
- When enabled, the extension monitors the focused window and applies the appropriate shortcuts for that application.
- Shortcuts are restored to their default state when the application is not in focus or the extension is disabled.
- All configurations are saved and persist between sessions.
